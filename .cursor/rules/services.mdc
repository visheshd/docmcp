 Prisma Instance Injection Pattern for Integration tests
 
 1. All service classes should accept an optional PrismaClient parameter in their constructor
 2. Use the main Prisma client as a fallback when no client is provided
 3. Store the Prisma instance as a private property

 Example:
 ```typescript
 constructor(prismaClient?: PrismaClient) {
   this.prisma = prismaClient || getMainPrismaClient();
 }
 ```

 This pattern allows for:
 - Using the standard client in normal operation
 - Injecting test database clients during testing
 - Easier mocking for unit tests
 - Better isolated tests to prevent test data cross-contamination
